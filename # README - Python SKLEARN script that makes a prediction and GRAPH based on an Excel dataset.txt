create a python script that makes a prediction and GRAPH based on an excel dataset

Sure! Below is an example Python script that reads data from an Excel file, performs a simple prediction using linear regression, and then plots the data along with the predicted values:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the dataset from Excel file
excel_file = "your_dataset.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file)

# Assume the dataset has two columns: 'X' and 'Y', where 'X' is the independent variable and 'Y' is the dependent variable

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X = df[['X']].values
y = df['Y'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X_train, y_train, color='blue', label='Training Data')
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='green', label='Testing Data')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Predicted Data')
plt.title('Linear Regression Prediction')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
In this script:

Replace "your_dataset.xlsx" with the path to your Excel dataset.
Adjust the column names as necessary ('X' and 'Y' in this example).
You can modify the size and style of the plot according to your preferences.
This script assumes a simple linear relationship between 'X' and 'Y'. If your dataset has more complex relationships, you may need to use more sophisticated models.
Make sure to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn openpyxl
This script will read your dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train a linear regression model, make predictions, and then plot the original data along with the predicted values.
